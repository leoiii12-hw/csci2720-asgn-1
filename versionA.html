                <p>We are five in my family. My father is a private employee and my mother is a homemaker. I have two
                    sibblings.</p>
                <p>About my achievements, I never made any achievements at state level. But in my schooling I got
                    certificate in singing level competition. In college I got NSS certificate which I participated as
                    volunteer in my 1st year of engineering.</p>
                <p>My strengths are hardworker, self motivating and dedicated towards my work. And also I'm a good
                    learner as well as teacher.</p>

<ul>
    <li>h1 (Leo Choi) will be bigger when the screen is big. I want to emphasize this website is made by me. So the size is quite big, as big as your monitor, but it is still visible.</li>
    <li>The image will also resize according to the full width.</li>
    <li>The table will also resize according to the full width.</li>
    <li>The text will wrap.</li>
